          The besy way to acheive most difficult things is through a throughtful, methodical approach.
          My goal is to become a full stack Javascript web developer. There's a long road between where
          I'm currently at and where I want to be. However, I'm prepared to take on the challenge.
          Not only that, but I'm willing to do it publically, with each one of my projects, my successes,
          and my faiulres out in the open so others may observe and potentially learn from the entire journey.
          If you feel a similar drive to improve, I'd love to know. Use the box below to share your goals.
